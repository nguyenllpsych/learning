2a. Path Analysis Foundations
4-Jan-2021
Instructor: Dr. Gregory Hancock
Notes: Linh Nguyen
*! All models are aggregated for notekeeping, need to be separated to run

TITLE:
    Example 1: Read Math Goals
DATA: 
    !no need for path if in same folder as script file
    !datafile has no header
    File is MPLUS_MLR_Exercise_rawdata.csv;
VARIABLE:
    !need to be in same order as datafile
    NAMES ARE ReadSC1 MathSC1 Goals2;
MODEL:
    !path model. default estimation method is ML
    Goals2 ON ReadSC1 MathSC1;
    !these 3 are included by default
    !1. variances for exogenous
    ReadSC1; MathSC1;
    !2. error for endogenous
    Goals2;
    !3. covariances between exogenous
    ReadSC1 WITH MathSC1;
OUTPUT:
    !SAMPSTAT: sample means, variances, covariances and correlations
    !STDYX: standardized solutions. there are more options
    SAMPSTAT STDYX;

TITLE:
    Example 2: 2 DVs Read Math Goals
DATA:
    FILE IS mvpa_example_data.csv;
VARIABLE:
    NAMES ARE ReadSC1 MathSC1 Goals2 SATmath;
MODEL:
    Goals2 ON ReadSC1 MathSC1;
    SATmath ON Goals2 ReadSC1 MathSC1;
OUTPUT:
    SAMPSTAT STDYX;

TITLE:
    Example 3: Standardized Exercise Hardy Fitness Stress Illness;
DATA:
    FILE IS MPLUS_Path_Analysis_Exercise_data.txt;
    !standardized correlation matrix
    TYPE IS STD CORR;
    !number of observations
    NOBS IS 373;
VARIABLE:
    NAMES ARE Exercise Hardy Fitness Stress Illness;
TITLE:
    Illness Model--Fit Assessment Exercise
DATA:
    FILE IS MPLUS_Path_Analysis_Exercise_data.txt;
    TYPE IS STD CORR;
    NOBS IS 373;
VARIABLE:
    NAMES ARE Exercise Hardy Fitness Stress Illness;
MODEL: 
    !final endogenous variable
    Illness ON Fitness Stress;
    !two intermediate variables
    Fitness ON Exercise;
    Stress ON Hardy;
    !show correlations between 2 exogenous variables in diagram and output
    !doesn't affect other estimates
    Exercise WITH Hardy;
OUTPUT: 
    SAMPSTAT STDYX;
