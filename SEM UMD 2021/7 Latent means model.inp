7. Latent Means Models
7-Jan-2021
Instructor: Dr. Gregory Hancock
Notes: Linh Nguyen
*! All models are aggregated for notekeeping, need to be separated to run

TITLE:
    Example 1: Group code analysis
DATA:
    FILE IS mimicdata.txt;
    !covariance matrix
    TYPE IS COVA;
    NOBS IS 2000;
VARIABLE:
    NAMES ARE satmath satprob satproc dummy;

MODEL:
    !specify latent factor
    !fix loading of satprob, not sat math
    mathprof BY satmath* satprob@1 satproc;
    
    !structural path for grouping variable
    mathprof ON dummy;

OUTPUT:
    SAMPSTAT STANDARDIZED;

TITLE:
    Example 2: Structured means - measured variable
DATA:
    FILE IS simple_data.csv;
VARIABLE:
    NAMES ARE tgoal satmath;
MODEL:
    satmath ON tgoal;
    
    !these two lines are default
    tgoal; satmath; 

    !squared brackets indicate means
    [tgoal]; [satmath];

OUTPUT:
    SAMPSTAT STANDARDIZED;

TITLE:
    Example 3: Structured means - latent variable
DATA:
    !separate datafiles 
    FILE (girls) IS means_data_girls.txt;
    FILE (boys) IS means_data_boys.txt;

VARIABLE:
    NAMES ARE satvoc satcomp satlang;

MODEL:
    !specify latent factor fix factor loading for satlang
    rprof BY satvoc* satcomp* satlang@1;

!anything not specified per group has equality constraints
MODEL girls:
    !factor mean for girls = 0 -> reference
    [rprof@0];

MODEL boys:
    !estimate the mean for boys
    [rprof]; 

OUTPUT:
    SAMPSTAT MODINDICES(3.841);

TITLE:
    Example 4: Latent means exercise English learner
DATA:
    FILE (chinese) IS ENGLISHchineseread.txt;
    FILE (korean) IS ENGLISHkoreanread.txt;

VARIABLE: 
    NAMES ARE read1 read2 read3;

MODEL:
    !specify latent factors for both groups
    read BY read1 read2 read3;

MODEL chinese:
    !chinese is reference group
    [read@0];

MODEL korean:
    !estimate mean for korean group
    [read];

OUTPUT:
    SAMPSTAT MODINDICES(3.841)
